## Features 
1. Snake grows as it eats the food
2. Food appears randomly on the screen after being eaten 
3. Game over if snake hits the game border or itself


## Learned 
1. use requestAnimationFrame to call the function continuously in async fashion
2. use grid to position and create snake and food
3. break logics down to smaller functions to build the game
